# swarm-swift

swarm-swift is a Swift implementation of OpenAI's open-source AI agents framework, Swarm. This project aims to provide a flexible and powerful tool for orchestrating multiple AI agents in Swift applications.

## Overview

Inspired by [OpenAI's Swarm framework](https://github.com/openai/swarm) and the concepts outlined in the [Orchestrating Agents cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/orchestrating_agents), swarm-swift brings the power of multi-agent AI systems to the Swift ecosystem.

Key features:
- Swift implementation of Swarm's core concepts
- Support for multiple LLM APIs, not just OpenAI
- Flexible agent orchestration
- Easy integration into Swift projects

## Status

⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently under active development. While we're working hard to implement and test all features, it's not yet ready for production use.

## Supported LLM Clients

swarm-swift aims to support various Language Model APIs. Currently, we're working on integrating:

- OpenAI
- Ollama
- DeepSeek
- ChatGLM
- Azure OpenAI

More may be added in the future based on community needs and contributions.
